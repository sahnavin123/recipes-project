    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the dough: Mix all-purpose flour and water to form a smooth and elastic dough. Cover it with a damp
            cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the filling: Mix the meat, chopped vegetables, spices, salt, and optional ingredients (such as
            soy sauce) in a bowl. Mix well and set it aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the momo: Divide the dough into small portions and roll each one into a thin round disc. Place a
            spoonful of filling in the center of the disc, and fold it over to form a crescent shape. Pinch the edges to
            seal the
            momo.
        </li>
        <li>
            Steam the momo: Place the momo on a greased steamer basket and steam them for 10-15 minutes, or until the
            dough is cooked and the filling is hot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the dipping sauce: Mix chili, tomato, garlic, and vinegar in a bowl to make the dipping sauce. Adjust
            the spiciness and tanginess according to your preference.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the momo: Arrange the momo on a plate and serve them hot with the dipping sauce. You can also serve
            them with a side of soup or broth.
