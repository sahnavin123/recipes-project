        Butter chicken, also known as murgh makhani, is a popular Indian dish made with boneless chicken pieces that are
        marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and lemon juice, then grilled or baked until tender. <br>The chicken
        is then simmered in a creamy tomato-based sauce that is flavored with butter, cream, and a blend of aromatic
        spices such as garam masala, cumin, coriander, and turmeric.

        <li>
            Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger paste, garlic
            paste, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cover and
            refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill or bake the chicken: Preheat the grill or oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken onto
            skewers
            (if grilling) or place the chicken on a baking sheet (if baking). Grill or bake the chicken until it is
            cooked
            through and lightly charred, about 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the sauce: In a large pot or pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add ginger paste, garlic paste, garam
            masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder. Cook for a minute until
            fragrant.
            Add chopped tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes are soft and mushy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Puree the sauce: Using an immersion blender or transferring the mixture to a blender, puree the sauce until
            it is smooth and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish the sauce: Return the pureed sauce to the pot or pan over medium heat. Add heavy cream, honey or
            sugar,
            and kasuri methi. Cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cooked chicken: Add the grilled or baked chicken to the sauce and simmer for a few minutes until the
            chicken is coated in the sauce and heated through.
        </li>
        <li>Serve: Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with naan bread or basmati rice.</li>
