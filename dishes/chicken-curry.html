        <li>
            Brown the chicken: Heat oil or ghee in a pan and add the chicken pieces. Cook them until they are browned on

        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the aromatics: In the same pan, add more oil if needed and saut√© the onion, garlic, and ginger until
            they are fragrant and softened.</li>
        <li>
            Add the spices: Add the spices to the pan and cook for a minute or two until they are fragrant and

            Add the liquid: Add the tomato puree, diced tomatoes, or tomato sauce to the pan and stir well. If using

            Simmer the curry: Add the chicken back to the pan and stir well to coat it in the sauce. Bring the mixture
            to a simmer, then reduce the heat and cover the pan. Let the curry simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the
