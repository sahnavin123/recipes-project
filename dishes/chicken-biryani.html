    <p>
        Chicken biryani is a classic South Asian dish that is made with fragrant basmati rice, tender chicken, and a
        blend of aromatic spices. <br>To make chicken biryani, the chicken is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt and
        spices, which helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor. <br>The rice is also soaked in water for a
        while to soften it and reduce the cooking time.
